Trailer Sequence Ideas
********MUST HAVE EPILEPSY WARNING (at least a brief on for the trailer)
	****MUST HAVE EPILEPSY WARNING ON THE GAME TO PUBLISH

OROROROROORR
start with Will you Blackout? (no sound, make this the quiet intro that
	serves to give contrast to the intensity and fast-paced environment
	that is Blackout)
When the gameplay starts, play the music, add visual effects to spice up the
	gameplay, and make sure that it sucks the player in with how intense
	and fast-paced the game is
go to gameplay (slower), and speed the gameplay up, then when the game has 
	been at capped speed for hard difficulty for a bit (10-15 seconds?)
	go to the screen with "Find out __/__/____"???

if there is a way in movie maker to pan around a video by zooming in and panning, then use that to zoom in a bit during gameplay and follow the player around rather than just showing the entire board for 30ish seconds during the trailer (could get pretty boring to just see the same board, even if it is getting faster)
